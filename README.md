# Cifar10-Cifar100
Image classification for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets using tensorflow

## About this project

This project is about implementing different **Deep Learning Architectures** and **Learning Techniques** on 3 image classification datasets:
  - [Fashion Mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
  - [Cifar-10 & Cifar 100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Fashion Mnist and Cifar Exercises were the final project of 9th semester university subject "Pattern Recognition".
In notebooks folder Cifar_10 and Cifar_100 notebooks contain the CNN models that achieved the highest accuracy(89.93% and  after a lot of research and experiments. Among others I experimented with:
  - New activation Functions
  - Data Augmentation
  - Model Callbacks(Checkpoints, Early Stopping, ReduceLROnPlateau(Learning Rate Scheduler), Tensorboard)
  - Regularization Methods(Batch Normalization, Dropout, Layer weight Regularizers)

Checkpoints for various experiments will be uploaded soon.
The project report explaining code and theoretical questions is in greek. **To be translated**
